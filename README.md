The Scrolling Effect project adds visual animations or transitions when a user scrolls through a webpage. It enhances user experience by making content appear dynamicallyâ€”such as fading in, sliding, zooming, or parallax effects. This is usually done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or libraries like AOS or ScrollReveal). The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing layout that grabs attention and improves engagement as users navigate the page.
